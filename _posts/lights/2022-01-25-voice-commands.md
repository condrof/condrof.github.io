# Using Alexa with Lights

If lights are hue enabled then do the following. For this example we will use `Standing Light` as the light name.
This works with both light names and light group names

* `Alexa turn on Standing Light`
* `Alexa turn off Standing Light`
* `Alexa Standing Light 50%` changes brightness to 50% or whatever number you want
* `Alexa turn Standing Light blue` if the bulb is a colour bulb then can change the colour of it
