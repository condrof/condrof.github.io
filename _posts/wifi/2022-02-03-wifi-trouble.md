# Connecting

* Wifi network is called VM2025977
* Password is taped inside press beside the fridge
* There is a guest network also `PrettyFlyForAWifi_5G` with password `ItHertzWhenIP`. That is the preffered connection for guests
* Wifi is provided by Virgin

# Under the stairs Setup

* Virgin Router
* Philips Hue Light Hub
* Raspberry Pi (running the ad blocker)
* 8 Port Switch. This runs internet throught the cables to tv in living room, to the kitchen and the attic

The main router is in the kitchen on top of the fridge.
There is another router in the attic. Between the 2 the house is covered

# Restarting the internet

If the internet is not working correctly then try restarting. Steps are:
* turn off the Virgin router under the stairs (white box with purple light). Leave off for 30 seconds and turn back on. It will take up to 5 mins for internet to work again
* If that does not work then restart the router on the fridge. Again wait up to 5 mins.
* If that does not work then there an issue with the internet ourside of our control
